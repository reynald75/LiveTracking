# Issue creation format
When creating an issue (Bug report, feature request, question or other), please respect the following guidelines:

## Required information
### Bug report
Use the `bug` [label](#labels).

Please be specific in stating the following in the report:
- Environnment (What device _**and**_ browser were you using when the bug occured)
- Intended action (What were you doing / trying to do)
- Expected behaviour (What were you expecting to happen)
- Actual behavior (What happened contrary to expected behaviour)
- Severity ([See severity](#severity))

If the bug is visual in nature, a screenshot or video of the bug occuring would be greatly appreciated.

### Feature request
Use the `enhancement` or `idea` [label](#labels).

To understand and better implement the requested feature, please describe the following:
- Need (What is the base need and the reason for requested feature)
- Desired behaviour (What do you want the feature to do)
- Timeframe/Severity (How important is this feature, and when would an acceptable deadline be if applicable. [Also see severity](#severity))

### Question
Use the `question` [label](#labels)

State your question along with the severity.

## Severity
The severity of an issue can be set using the `URGENT`, `IMPORTANT`, `NORMAL` or `LOW` [labels](#labels).

To better prioritize bug fixes and implementations, please state on the following scale how urgent the request is:

- **URGENT** - Needs to be addressed immediately, renders the application unusable
- **IMPORTANT** - Needs to be addressed soon, hinders usablity but does not render application unusable
- **NORMAL** - Needs to be addressed, small detail that can be fixed/added whenever
- **LOW** - Doesn't need to be addressed right away, idea or small detail that can be addressed some time in the future

## Labels
Labels can be set on the right hand portion of the issue creation page, click on the word `Labels` and select the relevant labels (severity and type).
